Xarra is an iOS app that turns written content into audio so you can listen to it. Whether it's text you write or paste, a document you attach, or an article you share from the web. It's designed for those moments when you want to go through content but can't be glued to a screen, like during a walk, commute, or doing chores. The app highlights the current line in sync with playback, and offers flexible controls and settings.
