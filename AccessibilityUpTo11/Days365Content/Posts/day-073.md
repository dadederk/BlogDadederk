What is the difference between isAccessibilityElement and accessibilityElementsHidden? The first one makes the view not accessible, but its subviews can still be accessible. The second one hides the view and all its subviews from assistive tech.

![There is a view containing 4 subviews. Three examples. In the three of them, all the subviews (that we'll refer to as 1, 2, 3 and 4) have the isAccessibilityElement property set to true. In the first example, the superview (that we'll refer to as A) also has the isAccessibilityElement property to true. That means that A is accessible, but 1, 2, 3 and 4 aren't. In the second example A has the isAccessibilityElement property set to false. That means that A isn't accessible, but 1, 2, 3 and 4 are accessible. In the third example, A has isAccessibilityElement to false and accessibilityElementsHidden to true. That means that A, 1, 2, 3 and 4 will not be accessible.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image136.jpg)
