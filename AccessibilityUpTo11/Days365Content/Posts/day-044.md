If an image does not convey additional information, maybe it's just used to make the UI look more attractive, it makes sense for VoiceOver to skip it. UIKit: set isAccessibilityElement to false. SwiftUI: create a decorative image explicitly.

![The photos app in iOS showing a “What’s new in Photos” screen. It has three new features, each one of them preceded of an icon. These icons could be considered decorative. The code shows how you can set isAccessibilityElement to false for an image view in UIKit and how SwiftUI has am explicit constructor with the decorative keyword, so VoiceOver ignores this element.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image161.jpg)
