There is an option for the user to request an experience with Reduce Motion and we should honor it. If your app has animations, make sure to check if the user has this setting on. Here are three examples where Apple does a great job.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 20. Reduce Motion. Three examples. In the App Store app, Apple sometimes has tiles with icons from apps or games that continuously moves for the user to get a sneak peek of all the icons. The second one is the Weather app, where there are quite realistic animations of the weather conditions in the background. The third one is the Stocks app. If you open one of your symbols, there is a banner at the top where your symbols keep automatically scrolling mimicking what you see on tv. In all these three cases, Apple completely stops the animations if Reduce Motion is on.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image13.jpg)
