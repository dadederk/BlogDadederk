Sometimes, buttons change meaning, for example when toggled. An example is a play button, tap it and it becomes a pause button. In such case, updating its accessibility label will be clearer than trying to convey the change with traits or values.

![Music app has a play button. When using VoiceOver, if selected, it will say "Play, Button". If you double tap, and if the accessibility label is updated, it will say "Pause". In this case, changing the traits instead of the label would make VoiceOver say something like "Selected, Play, Button". Or if changing the value, it would say something like "Play, On, Button". Very confusing!](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image121.jpg)
