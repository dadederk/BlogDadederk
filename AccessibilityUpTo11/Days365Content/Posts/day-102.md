When creating AXCustomContent objects for accessibilityCustomContent, you can specify the importance of the data. If it is high, it will always be presented by VoiceOver. You could potentially ask the user if that data is of importance to them.

![Twitter settings section. There is a setting called "Include usernames in timelines". You could implement accessibilityCustomContent to handle this setting. If it is on, the importance of this AXCustomContent representing the username is high. If it is off, the importance is the default one. In the first case, the username would be announced as part of the tweet. With the second one, the user would need to access the More Content rotor to access it.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image108.jpg)
