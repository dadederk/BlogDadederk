Let's quickly remember a few of VoiceOver's most important gestures that will let you do some of the most basic actions including selection, interacting, navigating, and scrolling. 

And Apple has a great video: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qDm7GiKra28&feature=youtu.be](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qDm7GiKra28&feature=youtu.be)

![VoiceOver Cheat Sheet, number 1. Showing 5 basic VoiceOver gestures. The first one is tap, which selects an element and VoiceOver announces it. In the example, the MobileA11y profile screen in the Twitter app selects the more options button, so VoiceOver says "More Actions, button". The second example is a double tap (anywhere on the screen), which means interacting with the selected element. In this case, because the more actions button is selected, it shows a modal screen with more actions. The third gesture is swipe right, which moves the cursor to the next element. In the example, VoiceOver moves the cursor to the profile picture and says "Profile Picture, button". The fourth one is swiping left, which would move the cursor to the previous element, from the more actions button to the search button. VoiceOver would say "Search, button". The fifth gesture is moving three fingers up, which will scroll the screen down.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image35.jpg)
