accessibilitySpeechSpellOut asks VoiceOver to speak the sequence of characters. Can be useful for things like promo/reference/authentication codes, phone numbers... it makes more sense to announce each character rather than words and big numbers.  

```swift
let codeLabel = UILabel()
let attributedLabel = NSAttributedString(
    string: "BAC1234567D",
    attributes: [.accessibilitySpeechSpellOut: true]
)
        
title.accessibilityAttributedLabel = attributedLabel
```

![An app shows a reference code and it shows how VoiceOver would announce it by default saying "BAC One million two hundred and thirty four thousand five hundred and sixty seven D". But by adding the accessibility speech spell out attribute it says of something like "Cap A Cap B Cap C One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Cap D".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image182.jpg)
