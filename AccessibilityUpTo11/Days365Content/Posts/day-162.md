A quick way for turning on, or off, VoiceOver is by using Siri. Say something like: "Hey, Siri! Turn on VoiceOver", and you'll find yourself using VoiceOver in no time. You can also do the same with other technologies like Voice Control.

![A user says: Hey, Siri! Turn on VoiceOver. And Siri would respond with: Ok, VoiceOver is now on. It displays also a notification at the top that allows you to switch it off again. You can also turn on other technologies like Voice Control, Smart Invert, Increase Contrast, etc. Finally, the user can also turn these off by saying something like: Hey, Siri! Turn VoiceOver off.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image65.jpg)
