Reminder to enable Larger Accessibility Sizes, so you can pick from one of the five extra accessibility sizes when configuring text sizes. You can do it from Settings, Accessibility, Display &amp; Text Size, and Larger Text.

![You can enable 5 extra accessibility text sizes, called Large Accessibility Sizes, by going to Settings, Accessibility, Display & Text size, and Larger Text. There are drawings of that screen. It shows how when toggling the Large Accessibility Size on, it allows you to pick up from 5 sizes and it compares how the screen looks when the larger text size is selected when this option is on, and off.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image67.jpg)
