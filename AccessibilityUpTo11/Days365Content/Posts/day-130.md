For other UI elements that could also benefit from being scaled when using Dynamic Type, you can use UIFontMetrics's scaledValue(for:). Some good examples are progress bar components, which tend to be quite slim.

![Two examples of the Netflix app, one with the default text size and another one with the largest accessibility text size. The progress bar for the first one is very thin. The second one is noticeably thicker. One way of doing this would be by setting the height anchor constraint of the bar to a value returned by the scaledValue function, passing the default height, in this case, 2.0, called from the default UIFontMetrics.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image84.jpg)
