There are a ton of things to love about SwiftUI. But one of my favorites it's got to be the possibility of previewing Variants: the possibility of seeing your UI in dark/light modes, all dynamic type sizes, and orientations, side-by-side.

![Variants can be found as a button in SwiftUI's content view in Xcode and let you choose between "Color Scheme Variants", "Orientation Variants", and "Dynamic Type Variants". Two examples in the image show Color Scheme Variants where it can be compared how the app looks in both dark and light modes, side by side. The second one shows the same with Dynamic Type Variants where you can see how your app looks in all possible text sizes, including accessibility text sizes.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image46.jpg)
