If you need to send announcement notifications that can step into each other, they will by default, interrupt ongoing announcements. But you can pass attributed strings as parameters too, letting you specify announcements to be queued.

![Two apps wit a downloads screen. The first one sends notifications when the downloads finish. With the default behaviour, new notifications will interrupt ongoing ones. It could be something like: "Episode 1 down", "Episod", "Episode 3 downloaded". The second one configures the accessibility speech queue announcement attribute to true for the attributed string that gets posted. It could sound something like: "Episode 1 downloaded", "Episode 2 downloaded", "Episode 3 downloaded".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image132.jpg)
