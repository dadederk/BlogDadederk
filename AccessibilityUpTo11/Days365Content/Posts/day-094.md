Creating UIAccessibilityElements, combined with a semanticGroup accessibilityContainerType, can also help you make components as complex as charts accessible.  

Example from "Bring Accessibility to Charts" WWDC21:

![App showing a chart with the title "Cups of coffee vs lines of code". If you select the bar for 1 coffee, VoiceOver would says something like "Cups of coffee vs lines of code, 1 cup. 30 lines of code", swipe right and it would say something like "2 cups. 35 lines of code". For that you can override the accessibility elements and map your data points to UIAccessibilityElements with a value describing the cups of coffee consumed and the lines of code produced. It also needs a frame in the container space.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image116.jpg)
