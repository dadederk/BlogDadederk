I used to think of Zoom as an accessibility feature that didn't need support from developers. But actually, testing with Zoom might unveil some issues and bad practices. Watch out for buttons that change something far away on the screen.  

Using a snackbar is usually not a good idea. Especially if it lets you do/undo something. Because they're ephemeral, they're difficult to spot and/or reach with Zoom, VoiceOver, Switch, Keyboard... Confirming a destructive action with a dialog might be better.

![An app for reading articles lets you tap a button for indicating that you want to see less content like that. When you do, a snackbar shows on the top of the screen indicating that and letting you Undo the action. When using Zoom, the user doesn't see the snackbar as it is appearing outside the zoomed region.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image41.jpg)
