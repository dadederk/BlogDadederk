![Apple TV app with the AX5 Dynamic Type configuration. The navigation bar and the tab bar look just the same as with the default configuration. A tap and hold to one of the tabs or the title in the navigation bar, though, will show a big square in the middle of the screen with a large icon or/and text previewing what we are touching.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image88.jpg)
