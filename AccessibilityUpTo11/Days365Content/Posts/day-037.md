The .selected accessibility trait indicates when an element has been selected. You’ll notice that VoiceOver announces “selected” before the accessibility label. You can find that in the system for the selected tab in the tab bar, for example.

![The accessibility shortcut setting is open. There is a list of options. VoiceOver, Switch Control and Voice Control have a check symbol to the left. Zoom has not. Illustration shows how VoiceOver will announce the ones with the check as selected, before the accessibility label.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image167.jpg)
