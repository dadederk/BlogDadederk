If you are using SwiftUI to build your apps, there is a fairly basic but very useful Accessibility Inspector built right there in the Inspectors Panel, on the right side of Xcode.

![Content view showing the preview of a SwiftUI interface consisting of a rating component where you can rate something from one to five thumbs up. In the Inspectors panel, there is an Accessibility Inspector. If you make the content view selectable, you can select any time in the preview and it will show some of the basic accessibility attributes for that component in the inspector. In the case of the rating component, the label is "rating", the value is "0" and the actions is "adjustable".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image47.jpg)
