Sometimes you can create your own accessibility elements from scratch to group elements too. Perhaps because they're not contained in the same superview. You can combine these elements' frames and provide a suitable accessibility label.

![Instagram app with rgillustrator's profile. There is the number of followers, following and posts with titles for these numbers displayed in columns next to the profile image. By default, because of the layout, VoiceOver would say something like "148, 1431, 823, Posts, Followers, Following" as you swipe to the right. But you can group and order these elements so you just need two swipes instead of five and so it announces it in a more logical order, something like "148 Posts, 1431 Followers, 823 Following". You can do that by overriding the accessibility elements array of the view containing all these labels, and create a new UIAccessibilityElement for each one of these pieces of information. You can combine the text in both labels (number and title) for the accessibility label, and create the union of both frames as the accessibility frame of the accessibility element.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image117.jpg)
