Anything representing a heading in the app should have the header trait. It allows for a faster way of exploring a screen and jumping to the part of the app you are interested in. Screens should also start with a header.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 3. Missing header trait for headings. BBC News app shows two sections Technology and Science & Environment. These sections consist of a horizontally scrollable carrousel of at least 5 elements. If the titles of the sections have the header trait, a single swipe down brings you from one section to the other, compared to 6 swipes to the right needed otherwise. At the top of the app, there's the BBC logo. Screens should start with a heading so the logo could also have the header trait. In UIKit you can insert the header accessibility trait to the accessibilityTraits property of the UI element representing the heading. In SwiftUI, you can use the accessibilityAddTraits modifier and pass isHeader as parameter.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image30.jpg)
