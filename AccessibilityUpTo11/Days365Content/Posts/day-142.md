Today I want to share something I use a lot. You can convert any article into a “podcast” by enabling Speak Screen in Accessibility Settings, switching to Safari’s Reader Mode and swiping down with two fingers from the top of the screen.

![In Accessibility Settings, you can go to Speak Content and Enable Speak Screen. When you are reading an article, you can select the Page Settings button, and then select Show Reader from the menu. Then, you can swipe down with two fingers from the top of the screen to show the Speak Screen menu and will start reading the text in the article.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image79.jpg)

I think it is a good example of how if we all knew more about how to use the assistive tech available in iOS, we would find ourselves using more of them, more often, exemplifying quite well that accessibility benefits everyone.
