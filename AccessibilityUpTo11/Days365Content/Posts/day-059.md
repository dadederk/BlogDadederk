Please, don't use accessibility labels as ids for your UI tests. It can completely ruin the experience for VoiceOver users. There is actually an accessibility identifier property that you can use instead to uniquely identify your UI elements.

![An app for booking flights has used the accessibility label property to uniquely identify elements, presumably for finding those elements on their UI tests. That means that VoiceOver will start reading something like “Plan underscore trip underscore ban underscore airport underscore description underscore label. Plan underscore trip underscore ban underscore origin underscore airport underscore gps underscore icon. Plan underscore trip underscore btn underscore airport underscore title underscore label”, instead of a more understandable sequence of labels, something like “From. London Gatwick”.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image148.jpg)
