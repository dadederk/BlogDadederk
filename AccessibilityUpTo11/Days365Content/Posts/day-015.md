Tip for abbreviations. Something like "3h 24m" will be read by VoiceOver as "3 h 24 meters". Formatters can help. DateComponentsFormatter with a "spellOut" units style will give you a more suitable label: "three hours, twenty-four minutes"  

Some useful links:
Date Components Formatter: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponentsformatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponentsformatter)
Units Style: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponentsformatter/unitsstyle-swift.enum](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponentsformatter/unitsstyle-swift.enum)

![Code shows how you can create a DateComponentsFormatter, configure its allowed units and the units style with spell out, and you can get a human readable string representing the time from it, by passing a time interval.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image180.jpg)
