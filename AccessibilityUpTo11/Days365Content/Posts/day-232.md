In UIKit you can create keyboard shortcuts by overriding the keyCommands for your view controller, which is an array of UIKeyCommand. A bit of a different approach to how you'd do it with SwiftUI.

![Calendar app opened on an iPad. There is a panel that shows the keyboard shortcuts available because the user is pressing and holding the command key. One of them is command + n to create a new event. You can override keyCommands which is an array of UIKeyCommand. In this case we configure "New event" for the title, an selector to open create new event as the action, "n" as the input, and command as the modifier flag.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/imageDay232.jpeg)
