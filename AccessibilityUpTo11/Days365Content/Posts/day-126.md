You should really try to support Dynamic Type. If you can’t for some reason, and you want to fall back to the Large Content Viewer, you can do so. I’d limit it to “sticky” bars. Maybe you have a custom tab bar, navigation bar, or similar?

Check the UILargeContentViewerItem protocol. Most UIKit components conform to it already. You'll just need to set showsLargeContentViewer to true and add a UILargeContentViewerInteraction to your component.
