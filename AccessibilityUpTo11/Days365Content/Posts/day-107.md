Grouping elements with .accessibility(children: .combine) doesn't always generate the best accessibility label. Comma-separating labels might sometimes not be ideal. But you can improve it by tweaking the labels/grouping of its children first.

![Stock Analyzer app uses an HStack to display some info. It is grouped for VoiceOver using the .accessibility(children: .combine) modifier. But the output is not perfect, as VoiceOver will say something like: "Price-to-Earnings, 29.13, X, Cap C". The comma separation for the labels does not always work like with the value and the "X". Also, Cap C doesn't mean much. So there's room for improvement. We can still use .combine at a high level, but we can improve the subviews for a better outcome. Group the HStack containing the number and the "X" with .accessibilityEelment() and create a better label manually. Something like "29.12 times". Finally, give the Cap C group an accessibility label that makes a bit more sense. Something like "C rating". Now VoiceOver will say something like "Price-to-Earnings, 29.13 times, C rating". Much better!](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image104.jpg)
