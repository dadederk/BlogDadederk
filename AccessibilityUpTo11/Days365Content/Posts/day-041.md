There is an accessibility trait for defining something that represents a custom keyboard's key: .keyboardKey. It allows VoiceOver users to change the typing mode to Direct touch typing. The calculator app or an access pin pad, are some examples.

![The calculator app. The buttons in the calculator have the keyboardKey accessibility trait. That allows VoiceOver users to select direct touch typing mode from the rotor. VoiceOver won’t say the word button after the accessibility label, to avoid verbosity. But it changes the intonation so they’re easier to identify. It allows multiple typing modes.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image164.jpg)
