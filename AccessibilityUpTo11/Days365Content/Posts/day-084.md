It is very important to label switches properly and avoid duplication when you find them in table views, like in settings. One way it's usually done, and probably the simplest solution, is by adding the UISwitch in the accessory view of the cell.

![The Display & Text size shows a table with several settings that can be toggled on or off with a UISwitch including: bold text, larger text, button shapes, etc. For doing something similar in your app, you should be able to add a UISwitch as the accessory view of your cell.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image126.jpg)
