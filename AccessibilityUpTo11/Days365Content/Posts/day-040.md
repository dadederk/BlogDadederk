Imagine playing a piano with VoiceOver. You'd have to find the key you want to play and then double tap. It would be a very difficult experience. With the .allowsDirectInteraction accessibility trait, VoiceOver passes through touch gestures.

![The garage band app is open. It shows how the top area of the app, with all the regular controls, can be used with VoiceOver as usual. The bottom part of the app, with the piano keys, has the allows direct interaction accessibility trait so it can be used with touch controls directly.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image165.jpg)

Use carefully! And only when it really makes sense to be able to handle controls directly with touch. Other examples could be a drawing app or some games.
