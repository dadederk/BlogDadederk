If you have interactions that are hidden or require complex gestures to be performed or that may conflict with VoiceOver, you need to provide alternative ways of executing these actions. Custom actions can help a lot of times, but not always.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 9. Hidden actions not being accessible. Find alternative ways of actioning hidden interactions or that require complex gestures or gestures that conflict with VoiceOver's. Two examples. The first one is swiping left in a table view cell to unveil a delete option. That could be fixed by adding delete as a custom action. Second example is a bottom sheet menu with a grid of options. You need to swipe down to dismiss it. You'd probably need to implement the escape gesture for VoiceOver and it would be a good idea to add a close button anyway.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image24.jpg)
