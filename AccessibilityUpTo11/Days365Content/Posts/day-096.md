The Audio Graphs API has some very nice features aside from being able to consume the graph as audio. You can give it a summary and it will also provide your users with trends, correlations, outliers... and statistics like min and max or the mean.

![The chart details screen provides a a summary, kind of like alt text for the graph. This needs to be configured when building your AXChartDescriptor in the code. It also offers some Features like the trend of the data i.e. "There is an overall increasing trend" or if there are outliers. It also shows some statistics, like minimum i.e. "Minimum: Dec 2021, 4254 steps" or the mean i.e. "Mean steps: 10211 steps". Theses features and statistics are calculated for you from the data points provided.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image114.jpg)
