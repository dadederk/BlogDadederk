Optimising for navigation by making a view accessible shouldnâ€™t come at the expense of the buttons in it not being accessible. Configuring custom actions will allow the user to access them using the Actions rotor.

![Twitter app open. VoiceOver's focus is on the first tweet. There are four steps required to execute a custom action. One: Rotate two fingers on the screen to show the rotor menu. Two: Continue doing so, till you find the Actions rotor. Three: Swipe up/or down (VoiceOver will start announcing the different actions: Activate, Default; Reply; Retweet; Like; Share via...; View tweet author's profile, etc). Four: Stop in the desired action and double tap to execute. A piece of code shows how you can configure an array of custom actions. Each element in the array is of type UIAccessibilityCustomAction and you initialise them with a name and an action handler.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image144.jpg)

With the Actions rotor, users can swipe up and down to cycle through all the options, stop at the desired one, and double tap to execute that action.

You can configure an array of custom actions. Custom actions can have a name that will be announced by VoiceOver and an action handler or target selector with the code that will be executed.
