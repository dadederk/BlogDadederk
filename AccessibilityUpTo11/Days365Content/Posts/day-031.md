Hacks are accessibility’s worst enemy. An example. There is a ‘trick’ floating on the internet: if you want a button with an icon to the right of the text, set the semantic content attribute to force right to left. Great way to create focus traps.

![A filter button has a funnel icon to the right of the text, it has been forced to be right-to-left. That changes VoiceOver so a flick to the right, will go to the previous element, a Shows heading, not the next one. Swipe right again, and you are back in the right-to-left filter button, and so on, and so on. ](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image171.jpg)
