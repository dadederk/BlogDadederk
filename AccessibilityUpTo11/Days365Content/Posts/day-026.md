Meet the rotor. A menu that you activate (and change options) by rotating two fingers on the screen. It lets you select different navigation modes and customizations. Like navigating through headings or changing VoiceOverâ€™s speaking rate.

![With VoiceOver on, rotating two fingers on the screen, like trying to rotate an invisible knob, will bring up the rotor menu. The same gesture lets you choose from one of its options. Swipe up/down to interact with the chosen option.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image174.jpg)
