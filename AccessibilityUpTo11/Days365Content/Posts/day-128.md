When configuring a largeContentImage or adjustsImageSizeForAccessibilityContentSizeCategory, it is important to use a pdf asset and preserve the vector data so the icons are crisp at any size.

![Two examples of the large content viewer. One of them has a crisp icon because the vector data for it is preserved. The other one shows a blurred icon. That's what would happen if the vector data of the image is not preserved. To preserve vector data for an image, you can find that option in Xcode's right panel, when selecting the image in the asset catalogue, in the first section called "Image Set" and after the Name, Render As and Compression options. ](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image86.jpg)
