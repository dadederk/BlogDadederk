Too much data can overwhelm users. Very little is an incomplete experience. It is hard to find a balance on verbosity and the users may have different preferences. To help with this issue, the AXCustomContent APIs let you mark data as optional.

![Podcast app is showing the episodes for the Empower Apps show. By default, VoiceOver would speak something like this for an episode: The 13th of July. 129. NSSpain X with Luis Ascribe. A very long description. And, 41 minutes. It is so much content! And important information like the duration is buried at the end of it. If AXCustomContent is implemented, and the description is configured as custom content. VoiceOver would read the date, title and duration. The user can then use the rotor and select More Content, and swipe down. VoiceOver would then announce the description.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image109.jpg)
