Have you noticed that the first time you select an element on Apple Podcast's mini player, VoiceOver says "Mini player", and then, it describes the selected element? It gives the user more context on what "feature" those elements belong to.

![Apple podcast app is open. When the user selects the play button in the mini player, VoiceOver will say "Mini Player, Play, Button". Swipe right and VoiceOver will say "Fast-forward, 30 seconds, Button". Sipe left again and VoiceOver will say "Play, button". For achieving that, you can override accessibilityContainerType for the mini player's container view and return .semanticGroup. You need to also override the accessibility label and return the string "Mini Player".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image124.jpg)

This can be achieved in UIKit by configuring the accessibility container type of the mini player with .semanticGroup and giving it an accessibility label, in this case: "Mini player".
