Manual testing is crucial. And therefore, reducing friction to let you start your testing process can be a huge help. Selecting some accessibility shortcuts will do that, putting most of iOS' accessibility features at a triple-click of a button.

VoiceOver, Switch Control, and Voice Control are selected in the example. Now triple-clicking the side button on your iPhone (or the home button if you still have one) will show an action sheet with the features selected previously.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image70.jpg)
