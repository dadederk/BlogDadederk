Grouping elements in SwiftUI is extremely easy! You can use the .accessibility(children: .combine) modifier. And that's it! It merges properties. For example, generating an accessibility label by joining the children's ones, separated by commas.

![Stock Analyzer app in the onboarding screen. There is a row, that by default VoiceOver will treat as four different accessibility elements, needing 4 swipes to navigate it. The labels are: "Price-to-Earnings", "29.13", "X", "Cap C" These components are in an HStack. If you apply the .accessibilityElement(children: ) modifier, passing the .combine argument, groups all the elements together and the new accessibility label will be: "Price-to-Earnings, 29.13, X, Cap C"](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image107.jpg)
