Sometimes it won't be enough to make colors darker or lighter for Increase Contrast. As always, it is important to do some testing. The same colors might be used with different backgrounds or text colors and the contrast could actually get worse.

![The stock app with Increase Contrast off. Values going up are in white over green with a contrast of 2.2 to 1 that fails. The widget on the other hand has green over black, being the contrast ratio of 9 to 1 and it passes. When turning Increase Contrast on, the green color goes darker. In the app, it is 7.3 to 1 and now it passes, but in the widget is now 3.7 to 1 and it passes only when the font is at least 19 points in regular or 14 in bold. But the point is that the contrast for the widget is now worse than when Increase Contrast was off.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image39.jpg)
