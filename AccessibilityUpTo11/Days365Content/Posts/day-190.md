[@BeMyEyes](https://twitter.com/BeMyEyes), founded by [@hjwiberg](https://twitter.com/hjwiberg), enables people who are blind and low vision to identify objects by pairing them with volunteers from around the world using their camera. Winner of an Apple Design Award 2021 for Social Impact.

![Drawing of Hans JÃ¸rgen Wiberg's Twitter profile picture, Be my eyes' icon, and a screenshot of the app: It says "Join the community. See the world together". It shows the number of blind users, 424,694, and volunteers, 5,939,952. There are two buttons, one says "I need visual assistance. Call a company or volunteer", and another one says "I'd like to volunteer. Share your eyesight".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image38.jpg)
