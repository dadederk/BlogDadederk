With the Accessibility Inspector you can check the value for the most common accessibility attributes for individual elements, do some basic navigation, and even perform actions if the component is adjustable or if it has custom actions.

![The accessibility inspector has a button that lets you select individual elements on a simulator or device. It is also possible to navigate element by element (like emulating left/right swipes with VoiceOver), automatically move through all the elements on screen, speak each element (rough VoiceOver emulation)… it is also possible to see what values the most common accessibility attributes have configured (label, value, traits, identifier, hint…). And even perform some actions: Activate, increment/decrement for adjustable components, and custom actions. A list of all the custom actions appear with a perform button next to it.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image63.jpg)
