Meet [@jordibruin](https://twitter.com/jordibruin) developer of Navi (and other great apps) and organizer of [@swiftuiseries](https://twitter.com/swiftuiseries) (with an accessibility category). Navi is sadly not available anymore but it was worth an Apple Design Awards nomination. It added subtitles to FaceTime!
