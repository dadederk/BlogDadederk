![Calendar of the Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 2. Better accessibility labels. A music player with some examples of how to improve your accessibility labels. Don't add the element type: for the like button, if the label is "Like button", VoiceOver will say "Like button, button". So just "Like" is perfectly fine. Avoid redundancy and verbosity. For the repeat button, the label "Repeat This is the last time from Kean" would be too long, and if we specify the song and band for every action, it would be too verbose. Localize. For the next track button, try to use a localized string instead of a plain string so VoiceOver speaks in the correct language. Start with a capital letter and don't end with a period. This helps with VoiceOver's inflection.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image31.jpg)
