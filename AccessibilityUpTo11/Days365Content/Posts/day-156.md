This is my favorite way of testing VoiceOver. Pick a flow in your app. Turn VoiceOver on. Triple tap with three fingers on the screen to enable Screen Curtain. The screen goes off but you can still navigate your device with VoiceOver.

![Spotify app is open. Swiping right, with VoiceOver on, it says "What's New Feed, Button", swipe right and it says "Listening history, Button", swipe right one more time and it says "Settings, Button". If you tap three times with three fingers, it says "Screen curtain on" and the screen goes off. But you can still navigate with VoiceOver. Swipe left and it will say "Listening History, Button" again, swipe left and it will say "What's New Feed, Button" again.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image71.jpg)
