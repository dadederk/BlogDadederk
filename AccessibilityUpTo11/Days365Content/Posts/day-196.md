Once you learn some basic gestures with VoiceOver, it is very important to master he Rotor. It is very useful to also know some more power user gestures like the Magic Tap or the Escape gesture.

![5 gestures from VoiceOver. There is a Twitter app open on the TwitterA11y profile screen. Rotating two fingers on the screen, like rotating a dial, will show you the rotor. In this case, a tweet is focused and VoiceOver will say: “Actions”. Then, you can swipe down to interact with the selected rotor option. VoiceOver will say in this example: “Reply”. Sometimes, you’ll need a double tap to confirm. In this case, doing so will open the screen to reply to that tweet. Back to the first screen, if you double tap with two fingers, that’s called the Magic Tap. It is meant to execute the most important interaction in the screen. In this case it will open the screen to compose a tweet. If you scrub with two fingers, like drawing a Z, it is called the Escape gesture. It should bring the user back to the previous screen. In the example, back to the TwitterA11y profile screen.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image33.jpg)
