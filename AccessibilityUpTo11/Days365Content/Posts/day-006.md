Attributed accessibility labels are a thing! They'll let you specify (for the whole accessibility label or a portion of it) VoiceOver's language, to read punctuation marks, spell it out, correct the pronunciation, or even change the pitch.

[@RobRWAPP](https://twitter.com/RobRWAPP) has a very detailed blog post explaining each one of these attributes: [https://mobilea11y.com/blog/attributed-accessibility-labels/](https://mobilea11y.com/blog/attributed-accessibility-labels/)

And here's Apple's official documentation for them: [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/speech-attributes-for-attributed-strings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/speech-attributes-for-attributed-strings)
