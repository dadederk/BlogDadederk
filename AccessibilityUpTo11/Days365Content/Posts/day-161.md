One thing I find very useful when testing (or doing demos!) is to have VoiceOver's caption panel enabled. It shows constantly at the bottom of the screen and you can see exactly what VoiceOver is saying.

![In VoiceOver's settings, if you scroll to the bottom, there is a setting called Caption Panel. When turning it on, a caption panel is shown constantly at the bottom of the screen showing exactly VoiceOver's output.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image66.jpg)
