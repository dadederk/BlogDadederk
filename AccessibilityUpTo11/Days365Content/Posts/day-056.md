It is possible to embed icons within text using NSTextAttachment and NSAttributedString. If you do, please remember to override the accessibility label, otherwise VoiceOver will announce it as "Attachment.png File".

![If you assign an attributed string to the attributed text property in a label, and the attributed string contains an nstextattachment that is an image, you need to override the accessibility label of the label. In the example, if you don't do it, VoiceOver would say: "Select the Attachment.png, File button to find elements in the list." If you do, VoiceOver would say: "Select the Search button to find elements in the list".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image151.jpg)
