The first one has a hud saying “Episode added to Up Next”. Toasts, snackbars and huds can be conveyed to VoiceOver usersa using accessibility announcements. The second one is a drop down to select the season which changes the episodes visible in the carrousel underneath it. A layout changed notification can help with changing content in the screen. The third one shows an episode with a download indicator. The updates frequently trait could help with that.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image21.jpg)
