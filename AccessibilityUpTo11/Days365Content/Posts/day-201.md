Images should either be decorative or have a proper accessibility label or alt text that describes them. If they're decorative you can make it so they get skipped by assistive tech so it doesn't get in the way of the experience.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 5. Images: with a description or decorative. iOS app with Disney+ showing the "How I met your mother" screen. The header has two images, one of them in the background, with the characters, that could be considered decorative. The other one is an image with the title of the series, which needs a description. In UIKit images are not accessible by default. So in the case of images that need to be accessible, you need to make the accessible elements. In SwiftUI images are by default accessible. You have an Image constructor with a decorative parameter, where you pass the name of the image.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image28.jpg)
