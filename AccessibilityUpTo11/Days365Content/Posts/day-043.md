Images that convey important information should have the .image accessibility trait and provide an alternative text in the accessibility label. "Image" will be added to VoiceOver's utterance and the user will be able to use Image Explorer.

![App shows how you can access Image Explorer for accessibility elements with the image accessibility trait, by using the rotor. The Image Explorer feature lets you find people, text and objects in images with VoiceOver, using computer vision algorithms that provide basic descriptions. For a Ted Lasso art cover, VoiceOver is describing the main character as: “Slight right profile of a person’s face with straight brown hair, including facial hair, smiling, near top-edge”.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image162.jpg)

Image Explorer is fairly new, introduced just a couple years ago. But if you were appropriately configuring the image trait, users suddenly got this new functionality for free. Isn't that awesome?

With VoiceOver on, open Image Explorer by swiping up in an image and double tapping. It lets users find people (with a basic description and positioning in the photo), objects or text in images, using on-device intelligence. It is very cool!
