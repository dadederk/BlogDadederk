The .accessibilityElement(children: ) modifier with the .ignore argument does a similar thing to set the container view to be an accessibility element in UIKit. It is the default argument, so you can just say .accessibilityElement().  

Because of this, you'll need to use other modifiers to make it accessible and manually configure an accessibility label and value, traits... when necessary.

![Two instances of the Stock Analyzer app showing you what it is included with the pro version and how much it costs. The first one uses .accessibilityElement(children .combine) to group three elements, and that causes VoiceOver to announce "Pound sign, 3 dot 99, per month, billed monthly". The second one uses .accessibilityElement() instead and uses the .accessibilityLabel() modifier to configure a label that sounds more natural. So in that case, VoiceOver will say something like "Three pounds and ninety nine cents, per month, billed monthly".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image106.jpg)
