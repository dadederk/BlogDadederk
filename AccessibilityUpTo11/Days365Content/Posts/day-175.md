Accessibility Labels are not just for VoiceOver, and Accessibility User Input Labels are not just for Voice Control. The latter will also help Full Keyboard Access users to find elements on the screen by different names. Good API design!

![With Full Keyboard Access on, you can use the shortcut tab + F to search for elements on the screen. If the accessibility label for a settings button is "settings", you'll only find that button by the word "settings". If you, on the other hand, configure accessibility user input labels and give it an array of strings like "settings", "configuration", "preferences", "gear", "cogwheel", and "sprocket", etc. you'll be able to find that button by all those strings.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image52.jpg)
