Zoom lets the user magnify the screen if the user needs to zoom in a region to be able to see any details a bit closer. It is useful to know the gestures that let you zoom in, back out, move around the screen, adjust zoom level or show its menu.

![You can find the Zoom settings in the Accessibility Settings. When enabled, double-tap with three fingers to zoom in and double-tap with three fingers again to zoom back out. Use three fingers to move around. Double-tap with three fingers and drag up/down to adjust the zoom level. And triple-tap with three fingers to show a menu to adjust a few Zoom settings like: Zoom In, Choose Region, Choose Filter, Show Controller and Adjust Zoom Level.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image42.jpg)
