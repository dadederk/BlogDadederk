Configuring the header accessibility trait, when appropriate, is one of my favourite accessibility quick wins. In this example, you need a single swipe down, instead of 12 swipes to the right to get to from Podcasts to Artists, in the app.

![There’s two sections in the app (Podcasts and Artists), preceded by a heading. The first one contains 12 podcast shows. It shows how you can navigate to the second section with a single swipe down to the next heading, compared to 12 swipes to the right if you didn’t had that option.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image173.jpg)
