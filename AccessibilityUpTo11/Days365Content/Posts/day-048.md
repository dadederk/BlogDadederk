Accessibility values are about state. Using them appropriately will make the experience better for Voice Control users. Think of a repeat button (values could be: off, one or all songs) or a notifications tab (value could be: x new items).

![A notifications button with a “Notifications" accessibility label and a “1 new item” accessibility value, will work well with Voice Control when the user says: “Tap notifications”. If everything “Notifications, 1 new item” was part of the accessibility label, it wouldn’t work as well for this use-case. A repeat button, with three states (off, all and one) needs this state as an accessibility value. The selected trait won’t be enough for representing all the states of this button.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image158.jpg)
