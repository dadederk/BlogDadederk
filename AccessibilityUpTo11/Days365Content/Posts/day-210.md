iOS and Xcode provide a wide variety of tools and options to deal with color contrast ratios. From system colors, that automatically support Increase Contrast, to high contrast color and asset variants, and even a built-in contrast calculator.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 14. Color contrast. Some of the tools available in Xcode that help you create apps with great contrast are the asset catalog which lets you provide high contrast variants for color sets and assets, and the color contrast calculator. Some examples show how text size also affects contrast ratios. White on Black passes for all sizes. A grey with a 4.5 to 1 ratio over black will fail on small text sizes. A grey with a 2.9 to 1 ratio over black, fails for all text sizes. You can also use system colors an make sure that your app works well with the High Contrast setting.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image19.jpg)
