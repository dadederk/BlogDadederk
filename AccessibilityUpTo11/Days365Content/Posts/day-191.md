I recommend running your app with Double-length Pseudolanguage. It is a great way to stress-testing your app and see how adaptive it is and if your UI will hold to other languages that might be a bit more verbose or even with larger text sizes.

![You can Edit Scheme from Xcode and in the Run section, you can scroll down and change the language for your app when you run it from Xcode. One of the languages available is Double-length Pseudolanguage. When doing that, every string in your app will double. In the example, the app goes from saying "Here's to the crazy ones..." to "Here's to the crazy ones... Here's to the crazy ones..."](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image37.jpg)
