Check for the traversal order of elements in your app. Sometimes, the default top-left to bottom-right order might not be the most logical one. Sometimes, you may consciously want to tweak the order. Some other times, grouping is the answer.

![Three examples of traversal order for three pieces of data in three columns. The first one says Followers and 550 underneath, the second one Following with 340 underneath, and the third one Posts with 750 underneath. In the first one, the order is: Followers, Following, Post, 550, 340, 750. This order is incoherent. For the second one, the order is: Followers, 550, Following, 340, Posts, 750. This one has a logical order. The third one's order is: Followers 550, Following 340, Posts 750. Where both name and number for each one of the pieces of data is grouped. It is clearer and the navigation is easier.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image16.jpg)
