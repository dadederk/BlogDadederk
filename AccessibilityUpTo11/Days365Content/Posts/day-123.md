What is the ideal distance between labels? It depends on styles for both of them and the dynamic type size, right? You wouldn't want to have the same distance for small and large text sizes. We can configure a standard distance between baselines.

![There is a piece of text composed of a title and some body text. One of them has the large text size, the default one. The other one has the AX5 text size configured. There is a line showing a constraint between the first baseline of the body and the last baseline of the title. The code configures a system spacing between them so it dynamically adapts to any configuration. That is a better solution than configuring a constant vertical space between labels, which wouldn't look good for all text sizes.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image90.jpg)
