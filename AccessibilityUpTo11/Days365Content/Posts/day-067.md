Custom actions work as great on Switch Control as they do in VoiceOver. It makes navigation much, much, faster and youâ€™ll be able to find all those custom actions in the Switch Control menu.

![Twitter app is open. Switch Control is on and the cursor is on top of the first tweet in the timeline. Switch Control's menu is being shown and in there you can find the main actions you'd expect to perform on a tweet: reply, retweet, like or share, among others. Making navigation and interaction much faster than if we were not grouping tweets as single accessibility elements and moving actions to custom actions. ](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image141.jpg)
