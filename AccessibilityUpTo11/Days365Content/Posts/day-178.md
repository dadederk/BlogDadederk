The Accessibility Inspector can be used with your device. It is actually quite interesting to check what other apps (or iOS) configure, for some of the basic accessibility attributes (label, value, traits, hint...), in their UI components.

![An iPhone is connected to a MacBook. The Accessibility Inspector is open. The Target an Element button is selected and when a component in the device is tapped, it gets highlighted and you can see the basic accessibility attribute values for label, value, traits, identifier, hint, and user input alternative in the Accessibility Inspector.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image49.jpg)
