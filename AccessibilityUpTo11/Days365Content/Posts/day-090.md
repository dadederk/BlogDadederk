Buttons with a title, use it as its default accessibility label. Most cases, that's just perfect. But there's a few times that you might want to tweak it. Maybe the image is part of what the button does, or the text in the title is not very clear.

![Two examples. The first one is the calculator with the number 365 in the result space. The clear button is selected. Its default accessibility label should be "C", as the letter "C" represents clear, but we could manually configure the label "clear" for clarity. The second example is the Apple Podcast app in the 13 letters podcast page. There is a button with a play icon and the words "Latest Episode". So the default label would be just "Latest episode" but we could manually configure one that says "Play latest episode" for extra accuracy.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image120.jpg)
