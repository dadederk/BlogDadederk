Test manually. Familiarise yourself with different assistive technologies. I find it useful to start with VoiceOver but check out Voice Control, Full Keyboard Access, and others... Remove friction, configuring shortcuts can help. Merry Christmas!

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 24. Test Manually. Go to Settings, Accessibility, scroll to the bottom, and tap Accessibility Shortcut. Select the accessibility features you'd like in the accessibility shortcuts menu. VoiceOver, Switch Control, and Voice Control are selected in the example. Now triple-clicking the side button on your iPhone (or the home button if you still have one) will show an action sheet with the features selected previously.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image9.jpg)
