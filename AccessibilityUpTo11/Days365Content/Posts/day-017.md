You can check if some features, like VoiceOver, are on. Experiences should not diverge too much. It could be used to avoid auto-hiding UI elements. iOS probably checks this to show search fields by default, without having to pull them down.

![Drawing shows how search bars in navigation controllers can be hidden so the user has to pull down to unveil them. When VoiceOver is running, iOS tends to show them by default instead. ](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image178.jpg)
