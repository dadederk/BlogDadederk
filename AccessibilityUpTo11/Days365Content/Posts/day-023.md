A common example where you need to manually configure the button accessibility trait is for some table/collection view cells. These tend to be “buttons” that perform an action, like playing music, or bring the user to a different screen.

![One app shows two cells representing podcast shows. Tapping those will open the details page. Therefore those cells will need a button accessibility trait. Another app shows two rows from a table view representing songs. Tapping them will play a song so they also need to get the button accessibility trait configured.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image176.jpg)
