It is useful to know these VoiceOver gestures to activate/deactivate Screen Curtain, pause/resume VoiceOver, easily simulate a long press for opening context menus, or quickly move the cursor to the screen's first or last elements.

![VoiceOver Cheat Sheet number 4. Five gestures. First one: Triple-tap with three fingers turns on/off Screen Curtain (which turns the screen off but still lets you use your device with VoiceOver). Four taps if you use VoiceOver together with Zoom. Second: Single tap with two fingers pauses/resumes VoiceOver. Third: Triple-tap with one finger simulates a long press (useful for opening context menus). Fourth: Single tap with four fingers in the top half of the screen moves the focus to the first element of the screen. Fifth: Single tap with four fingers in the bottom half of the screen moves the focus to the last element of the screen.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image8.jpg)
