VoiceOver announces "Tab bar" or "Toolbar", the first time you select an element in one of these components. If you are implementing your custom versions of these, you can mirror this behaviour, as seen in previous tweets.

![Two examples. The first one shows the Apple TV app. When VoiceOver's focus moves from outside the tab bar to one of the elements in the tab bar, it will prepend the accessibility label of the container view, in this case "Tab bar" to the regular announcement for that element. In this example: "Tab bar, Watch Now, Tab, 1 of 5". Same happens for toolbars. The second example shows the Mail app. When moving the focus from outside the toolbar to the toggle filtering button, it will say: "Toolbar, selected, Toggle Filtering, Button".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image123.jpg)
