It is not just about applying accessibility APIs, but about caring, and thinking of features that can make your app more accessible and inclusive to everyone. Twitter's alt-text feature is a great example. Thanks, [@TwitterA11y](https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y)! You'll be missed.

![When composing a tweet, and adding an image, there is a button that lets you add some alt text to it. On a separate screen, you'll be able to write up to 1000 characters. There is a link to find some help on how to write alt text. After publishing a tweet with an image with alt text, an ALT badge will be shown at the bottom left corner of the image and tapping it, it opens a modal view with the alt text configured.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image55.jpg)
