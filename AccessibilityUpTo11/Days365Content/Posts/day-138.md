You can add an observer to listen for changes in the content size category, in case it is more convenient than overriding traitCollectionDidChange(_:).

![You can add an observer to the default Notification Center. The name is didChangeNotification from UIContentSizeCategory and you can pass a selector to get executed when that happens. In the example, we are reloading a web view when the content size category changes so the font adapts to the Dynamic Type size configured.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image83.jpg)
