The Accessibility APIs are generic and flexible. They're not just for VoiceOver. If you implement them right, you can do it once and it will very likely work great for VoiceOver, Voice Control, Switch Control, Full Keyboard Access, and more.

That's why, to start with, we tend to focus on VoiceOver, the same way you may focus on keyboard navigation for the web. A great VoiceOver experience will get you most of the way to a good experience with the other assistive technologies.

We've seen one example with Custom Actions. One implementation works for:

Switch Control: [https://x.com/dadederk/status/1551236244088279040](https://x.com/dadederk/status/1551236244088279040)
Full Keyboard Access: [https://x.com/dadederk/status/1551874732504629249](https://x.com/dadederk/status/1551874732504629249)
And Voice Control: [https://x.com/dadederk/status/1552253520182640645](https://x.com/dadederk/status/1552253520182640645)

Of course that doesn't mean you don't have to test and check how the experience is with the other technologies. But before feeling overwhelmed, or for small teams, making sure your app works for VoiceOver is a great start.
