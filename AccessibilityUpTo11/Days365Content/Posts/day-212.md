A reminder that the more modes we use to convey important information, the more sure we'll be that it will be perceived by all our users. Consider a combination. of color, icons, messages, sound, haptics, animations, etc.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 16. Multimodal information. One example shows an app where you need to introduce a 6-digit pin. When it is the wrong pin, it does a shake animation on the pin field. It is using one mode: animation. If reduce motion is enabled, or for VoiceOver users, this information will not be perceived. The second example shows the same app but it adds a warning icon and a message that says "Incorrect pin" in red and the device also vibrates and does a sound to indicate the error. It uses several modes: animation, iconography, messaging, color, sound, and haptics. This is preferred. ](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image17.jpg)
