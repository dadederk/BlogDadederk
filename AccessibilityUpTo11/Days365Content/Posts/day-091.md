You can check if VoiceOver is running but you can also get a notification to act in case that changes, while the user is using your app. As seen before, you rarely want to do significant changes in the experience when VoiceOver is on.  

But this use-case presented by [@djembe](https://twitter.com/djembe) from [@NetflixEng](https://twitter.com/NetflixEng) at [@appbuilders_ch](https://twitter.com/appbuilders_ch) is an excellent example of inclusive design. When VoiceOver is on, they bump the Audio Described "genre" to the top of the list. Brilliant!

These series of tweets tend to be fairly technical but as John says, a big part of creating great accessible user experiences is about "being kind", about caring about your users and customers to come up with great features like this one.

![Netflix app is open and showing the categories menu. If you have accessibility shortcuts on, you can triple click the side button on your device to show the accessibility shortcuts menu. If you select VoiceOver, the Audio Description synthetic genre is now on top of the list. This can be achieved by listening to the VoiceOver status did change notification and do the necessary changes. The code in this illustration is borrowed from the talk "Accessibility for iOS: doing well by doing good" by John Fox (Engineer at Netflix) for the App Builders 2020 conference.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image119.jpg)
