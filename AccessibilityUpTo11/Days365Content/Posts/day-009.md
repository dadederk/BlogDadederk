accessibilitySpeechIPANotation is sometimes handy in English where a word is spelled the same but pronounced differently depending of the context. Some examples are: live, read... Or you may want to correct how VoiceOver pronounces your app's name!  

![Example shows how you can specify the correct pronunciation for the text “Most read” and for the word “Live” in the context of direct broadcasting, using the IPA notation. The code sets an accessibilityAttributeLabel to the UILabel (or UIView) with the string and a dictionary containing the accessibilitySpeechIPANotation attribute key and the “Most rēd” or “laɪv” values.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image185.jpg)

[Example code in the image:](https://gist.github.com/dadederk/4d8fa6cd8a6d4a5b7ee2e9d50f8cd402)

```swift
let liveNewsChannelView = UIView()
let attributedLabel = NSMutableAttributedString(string: "24 hour news channel. ")

attributedLabel.append(NSAttributedString(string: "Live",attributes: [.accessibilitySpeechIPANotation: "laɪv"]))

liveNewsChannelView.accessibilityAttributedLabel = attributedLabel
```
