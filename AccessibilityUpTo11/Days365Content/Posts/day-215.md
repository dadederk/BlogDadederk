Accessibility labels might not be the best input labels, used for example to find or interact with elements with Voice Control or Full Keyboard Access. In those cases, you can provide accessibility user input labels.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 19. User input labels. One example shows Apple's Podcast app in the 13 letters podcast page. There is a button in the top right corner with a + icon. The default label is "Follow". That might not be everyone's first guess on how that button is named. You could add "Plus" and "Add" as alternative labels. The second example is some episodes of that same podcast. The default label is very long consisting of a few details about each episode like the publication date and title. That might be a bit long for Voice Control. You can use just the title, or the word "Episode" as possible input alternatives.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image14.jpg)
