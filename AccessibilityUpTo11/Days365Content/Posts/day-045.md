When interacting with a button with VoiceOver, the accessibility label is repeated to the user. If you are playing some audio, it could be difficult to listen to it properly. To avoid that, you can add the .startsMediaSession accessibility trait.

![An app for learning Dutch has an audio clip to play how you would say Hi. When the play button is focused with VoiceOver, it says: “Play, button”. If you double tap the play button, VoiceOver will say: “Play” at the same time that the audio clip plays, saying: “Hoi!”. If you add the starts media session accessibility trait, VoiceOver won’t say anything back when double tapping the button, and you’ll just hear the audio clip saying: “Hoi!”.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image160.jpg)
