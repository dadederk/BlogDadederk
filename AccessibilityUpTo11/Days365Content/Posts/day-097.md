When something is focused with VoiceOver, if you double tap on the screen, it will be like interacting with the centre of the focused element. If you need to change that, you can customise the accessibilityActivationPoint.

![Spotify app icon in iOS Home Screen. Activation point is in the middle. So if you double tap, the app will open. If you swipe down, though, VoiceOver says "Edit Mode" and if you double tap, iOS will enter into "Jiggle Mode". The icons will continuously jiggle and a delete icon will appear in the top left corner. If you swipe down one more time, VoiceOver will say "Delete" and the activation point will move to the delete icon, instead of being in the middle of the app icon. So if you now double tap, iOS will prompt you with the delete dialog instead of opening the app.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image113.jpg)
