The Accessibility Inspector let’s you run an audit of the current screen in your simulator or device. It can find some basic issues like color contrast issues, touch target sizes that are too small, etc. It can also provide with fix suggestions.

![Audit functionality of the Accessibility Inspector. You can navigate to any screen you’ like to audit and select the “Run Audit” button. A list of possible issues will appear. Some examples are: hit area is too small, element has no description, potentially inaccessible text, dynamic text font sizes are partially unsupported… The options button will show a list of all the type of  issues it can find. You can unselect any of them. The options are: element description, contrast, hit region, element detection, clipped text, traits, and large text. Next to each issue found, there are two buttons. One of them takes a screenshot and highlights the area with the potential issue. The other one shows a fix suggestion. At the bottom of the screen, there is a clear warnings button.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image62.jpg)
