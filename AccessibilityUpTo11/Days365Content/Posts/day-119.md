One of my favourite Dynamic Type tricks is to use Stack Views and flip the axis from horizontal to vertical given a certain content-size-category threshold. So effortless and it works so well in so many scenarios.

![Two examples of a song row in the Apple music app. One is for the large (default) size. Hypothetically, it could be build using three stack views: a horizontal one that holds what I've called main content stack view and the more options button, horizontally; the main content stack view, which has a horizontal axis too, with the cover art and another stack view, this one with a vertical axis, for the title of the song and the name of the band. The second example shows that if you change the axis for the main content stack view, from horizontal to vertical, the cover art will come before the stack view for the title of the song and the name of the band, leaving much more room for text to be displayed.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image93.jpg)
