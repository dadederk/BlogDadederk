The accessibilityFrame is, by default, the frame of the accessible element. But you can change it. For example, you could expand it, so the interaction area is larger and easier to interact with, and so the user finds less "dead space" in the app.

![BBC Sounds app is open. There is a carrousel of cards. The cards have a label and a play button, both accessible elements. They fill a small part of the card. So most part of the card is "dead space" and will produce a sound to VoiceOver users, when they interact with it, signalling there's nothing accessible there. The accessibility frame of the label could be changed so it fills a bigger part of it. The coordinates need to be converted to screen. Luckily there is a very convenient method for doing so: you can call convertToScreenCoordinates from UIAccessibility.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image125.jpg)
