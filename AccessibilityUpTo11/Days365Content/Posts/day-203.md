Grouping elements when it makes sense can make a huge impact on easing navigation with some assistive technologies like VoiceOver, Switch Control, or Full Keyboard Access. It also helps on reducing redundancy.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 7. Grouping elements for easier navigation. There is an example using the Foursquare app. There is a list of restaurants. Each restaurant has a name, type, location, and rate. By default, you'd need four swipes to the right with VoiceOver to go from one restaurant to the next one. That's 32 swipes to go through 8 restaurants. If we group all these, it is just a single swipe to go from one item to the next one, easing navigation a lot. There is another example showing Next Door. The post in the example would require 9 swipes. So you can see how things can quickly get worse for more complex views. In that case, each post has a more options, like, reply, and share buttons that would repeat for every single item causing lots of redundancy.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image26.jpg)
