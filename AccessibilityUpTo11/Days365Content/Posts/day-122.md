Ever wondered what the ideal width is for labels so the text is readable? Well, it depends. But readableContentGuide has you covered. You can configure the optimal width independently of Dynamic Type size or Size Classes.

![There is an iPad with a title and some text. It has the default text size and the text has fairly large margins on both sides so the text can be read without having to move your head too much. You could fix the width, but then for large sizes, it wouldn't work that well. Instead, you can configure the width anchor of your labels to be equal to the width anchor of the readable content guide. That way, the width of the label will be optimised for the dynamic type text size chosen. Another example shows how margins are smaller for extra-extra-extra large sizes, and for AX5, there are barely any margins and the text goes almost side to side of the iPad.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image91.jpg)
