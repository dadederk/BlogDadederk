Apple asks us to consider the combine behavior, before using ignore, for .accessibilityElement(children: ). And for good reason, if combine works, and later on you decide to change the UI, the accessibility attributes will be updated for you.

![Two instances of the Stock Analyzer app. The first one shows a row with a criteria i.e. Price-to-earnings, and the value for that criteria i.e. 29.13x. The second one is the same but we'v added a rating code represented by a capital letter i.e. C. If we use .accessibilityElement(children: .combine), that code will work even if we update the UI like that. If we use .accessibilityElement() and therefore, we configure an accessibility label manually, we need to remember to update the accessibility label as we update the UI.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image105.jpg)
