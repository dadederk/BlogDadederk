Potential benefits from grouping logical pieces of information and moving buttons to custom actions: reduce redundancy (by removing repetitive controls) and reduce cognitive load (by making easier to know what item will be affected by each action)

![Tumblr app is open. If each post is not grouped and its buttons are not custom actions, VoiceOver would announce: author, report, post, share, reply, re-blog, like, author, report, post, share, reply, re-blog, like, author, report, post, share, reply, re-blog, like... Notice how share, reply, re-blog and like, keep repeating over and over (the author and post can be different in each post). If a user selects a like button, VoiceOver will say: "Like". It is unclear what you are liking. If you group elements in the post and move buttons to custom actions, VoiceOver will announce something like: author + post, author + post, author + post. Much less verbose and cluttered than the other option.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image142.jpg)
