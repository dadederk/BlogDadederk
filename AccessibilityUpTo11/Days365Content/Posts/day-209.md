Sometimes, you may want to create a custom component, even if there is a similar one in UIKit because you want to style it in a way that the default one won't let you. That's fine, just take into account that you'll need to make it accessible.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 13. Custom components can need a bit of work. If you develop a custom tab bar, you need to set the tab bar accessibility trait in the container, then you need to set up the container type with the value semantic group, then give it a localised string, "Tab bar", as an accessibility label. Also, you need to set up the large content viewer by setting show large content viewer to true and adding the interaction to the buttons... If you use Swift UI, the .accessibilityRepresentation(representation: ) modifier can help you create more accessible custom components.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image20.jpg)
