Adding keyboard shortcuts in your SwiftUI apps is extremely easy. Just use the .keyboardShortcut(_:) modifier. When pressing and holding the command key, the shortcut will appear in the shortcuts list.

One of them is command + n to create a new event. Applying the .keyboardShortcut(_) modifier with "n" as a parameter, to the plus button, is all you'd need. Now that shortcut is equivalent to tapping the plus button in the app.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/imageDay231.jpeg)
