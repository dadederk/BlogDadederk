The Accessibility Inspector has a Notifications log that you can find in Window, in its top menu, and then Show Notifications. It shows accessibility-related notifications like layout changed, screen changed, or announcements...

![Accessibility Inspector Notifications window shows a log of the notifications sent and the time they were sent. Some examples of notifications are UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification, UIAccessibilityScreenChangedNotification, UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification, etc.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image48.jpg)

I learned about this feature from the Accessibility Inspector in this article by [@basthomas](https://twitter.com/basthomas). A very recommended read to learn all about the Verifying VoiceOver with the Accessibility Inspector.
