Toggles or UISwitches are often found separated from the label that precedes (and describes) them; with an unclear label; missing a value, trait, or hint; or even not being actionable at all.

![Calendar of Advent of iOS Accessibility. Day 10. Bad experience with toggles. Very often toggles or UISwitches are not grouped together with the label preceding them or lack of the right values, traits and hints. Three examples. With the first one VoiceOver just says "Shared accomodation" and it is not even actionable. The second one focuses first on the label and then on the switch. VoiceOver says "Event cancellations" and then "Switch button, on, doublet-tap to toggle setting". The third one does a similar thing but treats the switch as a button. VoiceOver says: "Like" and then "Button". All quite confusing. With UIKit you can configure your UISwitch as the accessoryView for a table view cell. With SwiftUI you can use a named Toggle that lets you specify an associated label.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image23.jpg)
