I'll never recommend creating a custom component if there is a native one that does the job. But if you develop a custom tab bar, .tabBar accessibility trait comes to the rescue. Apply to a container view and its buttons will be announced as tabs.

![An app that looks like Swarm has a custom tab bar. If the container view of the tab bar has the tabBar accessibility trait and its property isAccessibilityElement is false, its three buttons would be announced as: “selected, personal feed, Tab, 1 of 3”, “check-in, Tab, 2 of 3”, “friends, Tab, 3 of 3”. It indicates they’re tabs and their position in the custom tab bar.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image163.jpg)
