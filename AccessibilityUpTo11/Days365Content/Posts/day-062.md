When setting isAccessibilityElement to true, assistive tech like VoiceOver will stop looking for other accessible elements in that view hierarchy. So if we make a view accessible, its subviews, including buttons and labels won't be accessible.

![A tweet is composed by several UIKit elements: A UIImage for the profile picture; maybe 3 UILabels for name, username and date; a UIButton for more options; probably a UITextView for the text of the tweet; 4 more UIButtons for comments, retweets, likes and share, etc. Just with this elements (because all of them have the isAccessibilityElement configured to true by default), VoiceOver would focus in 9 or so UI elements. If we configure isAccessibilityElement to true for the container view, VoiceOver will see the whole thing as a single accessibility element, and everything else inside the view, will be ignored.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image146.jpg)
