Custom actions work with VoiceOver, Switch Control and Full Keyboard Access. They also do for Voice Control. You can say "Show actions for &lt;item name/number&gt;", and an action sheet with all options, numbered, will be presented to the user.  

For some use-cases, Voice Control users might not feel it is a big win. Navigation is not as big of an issue, and interacting with custom actions might be a bit trickier than with "exposed" buttons. But lots of times seems a fair compromise.

![Two steps to show the custom actions with Voice Control. Using the Twitter app as an example. First, you can say "Show numbers" and iOS overlays numbers to each interacting item on the screen. Second, you can say: "Show actions for 6" and an activity sheet menu is shown with all the actions for that item. There are numbers for each one of the options. 3 is the number for 3. So finally, to like the tweet, you can just say "3".](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image138.jpg)
