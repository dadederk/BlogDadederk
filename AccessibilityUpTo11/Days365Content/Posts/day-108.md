In UIKit, to create an adjustable component we need to add the adjustable trait and override both accessibilityIncrement() and accessibilityDecrement(). In SwiftUI, everything you need is bundled in the accessibilityAdjustableAction(_:) modifier.

![If you create a custom page indicator in SwiftUI, you can make it accessible in SwiftUI by using the .accessibilityAdjustableAction(_: ) modifier. In UIKit, you need three steps instead: add the .adjustable accessibility trait, override accessibilityIncrement(), and override accessibilityDecrement(). The code in SwiftUI is all in one place, the adjustable action modifier provides a closure with the direction of the action. You can use a switch to implement code for each one of the cases, in this case .increment, and .decrement.](/Images/365DaysIOSAccessibility/image103.jpg)
