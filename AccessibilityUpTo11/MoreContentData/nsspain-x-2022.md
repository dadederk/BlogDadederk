Global Accessibility Awareness Day's co-founder Jennison Asuncion reminded us: we need to go from one day of awareness, to one year of action. I want to help the iOS community lead that change. We’ll look at three steps: First, make accessibility second nature: it’s part of our job as iOS engineers. Second, demystify accessibility: starting is easier than it looks. Third: explore advanced features: once you master the basics, you can create truly inclusive experiences.
