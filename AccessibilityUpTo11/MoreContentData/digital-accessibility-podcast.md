Dani Devesa Derksen-Staats, former iOS Accessibility Engineer at Spotify, The Times, The BBC and SkyScanner Joins Joe to discuss all things Mobile and iOS Accessibility.

We discuss his own experience within the field of Mobile and Digital Accessibility and general iOS Development, how all developers and engineers can make a small change to their thinking to make a huge impact, and discussing the mentality of Progress over Perfection and how we need to make mistakes to learn from them and improve.
